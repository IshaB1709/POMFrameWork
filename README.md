# POMFrameWork 
This Repository is for learning and implementing Page Object Model (POM) design model using Selenium Framework in JAVA.

What is POM?
Every website contains multiple webpages, like Login Page, SignUP Page,HomePage etc. In POM, a class is created for each Page which contains all the elements of the Page and all possible Page Actions.Page Actions should return the beahavior of the features under test and should be validated by the respective test client.

For each Page class, we create a corresponding Test Class to validate whether the functionality/Page Actions mentioned in the Page Class are working fine or not.
